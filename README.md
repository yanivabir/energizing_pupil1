[Experimenter sets participant up, directs to place fingers on d, g, j keys]

- Thank you for participating today. 
You will now complete a computer task about curiosity. In this task, you will listen to a series of trivia questions about animals, the arts, food, or geography.
Press 'd' to read the instructions for this task.

- For each question, you must decide if you want to know the answer to the question.
If you want to find out the answer, you will have to wait a certain amount of time. The required waiting period for each answer will be read out to you after you hear the question.
If you do not want to wait to see the answer, you can choose to skip the question.
If you are 100% certain that you already know the answer to the question, you may indicate that you already know it.
If you choose to skip or indicate that you know the answer, you will NOT see the answer to the question.

- To wait for answer, you will press the 'd' key.
To skip the answer, press the 'g' key.
If you 100% know the answer, press the 'j' key.
Refer to this diagram below to make sure you understand which key to press.

- If you choose to wait for a question, you will be asked to rate if the answer was worth waiting for on as scale of 1 to 5. 
If the answer was not worth the wait, it should be rated as 1. If it was extremely worth it, rate it as 5. Use numbers 2-4 for annything in between.

- To rate the answer, please speak the number you choose ("one", "two", "three", "four", or "five") into the microphone.
Please only use whole numbers, no fractions.

- The task will continue for 35 minutes. The task takes the same amount of time regardless of how many questions you choose to skip or wait for, so please base your decisions on how interested you are in learning the answers.

- You will soon complete a short practice to get comfortable with the task. Please use this time to get used to pressing the different buttons, to rating the answers out loud, and to the amount of time you have to respond to the different prompts.

[Four practice trials. Textual prompts dispalyed below fixation to direct pariticpant when and how to respond]

- During this task, we will be recording your eyes using the camera in front of you. 
For this purpose, we need you to always be looking at the target displayed at the center of the screen, unless you are taking a break.

- When the computer is ready to play a question, the target will appear on the screen.
When you are ready to hear it, gaze at the target. When the target rotates, that means that the computer registered your gaze correctly. Shortly after that, the question will play.
From there on, each quesitons is played just as before, and you respond just as you practiced.

- If your gaze leaves the target after you initiated a question, the game will stop and the computer will beep to indicate it had lost your gaze.
Try to keep your gaze on the target for the entire sequence: question, answer, and satisfaction rating. Use the intervals between questions, to rest, look away, or blink as much as you need.

- You will now complete a short practice to get comfortable with directing your gaze and responding. Please ring the bell now to call the experimenter.

[4 trials with experimenter in the room to make sure understands when to responnd. If having trouble or didn't choose to wait or skip at all, experimenter can have the participant repeat this practice.]

- Press 'd' to begin the task. This part will be 35 minutes long.
